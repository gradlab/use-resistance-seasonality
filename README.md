Included are all code and raw data need to reproduce all analyses associated with this preprint. Antibiotic use data was obtained from the Massachusetts All Payers Claims Database (https://www.chiamass.gov/ma-apcd/). Antibiotic resistance data for 3 organisms, *Staphylococcus aureus*, *Escherichia coli*, and *Klebsiella pneumoniae*, was obtained from Brigham and Women's Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital.
